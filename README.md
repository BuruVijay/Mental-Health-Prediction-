 Mental Health and Stress Prevention System
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system that helps predict mental health risks by analyzing lifestyle patterns, behavioral indicators, and stress-related data. The goal is to enable early intervention and provide actionable insights to prevent mental health issues before they become severe.

Problem Statement
Mental health challenges often go unnoticed until they escalate. This system uses AI to analyze user inputs and predict whether an individual might require mental health support, enabling preventive care rather than reactive treatment.

 Features
 Stress Level Prediction
Predicts whether a person may need mental health treatment based on daily habits, stress signals, and behavioral traits.

 Behavioral Pattern Analysis
Analyzes changes in work interest, coping struggles, and social behavior to detect mental health decline.

 Modular Architecture

Stress Assessment

Mood/Behavioral Pattern Recognition

Risk Analysis

Early Intervention Recommendation

 Privacy-Safe
No personal identifiers are used. All inputs are processed in a secure and anonymized way.

 Machine Learning
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: ~73%

Target Variable: treatment (Yes/No) â€“ predicting the likelihood of needing mental health treatment

Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized records containing:

Demographics (Gender, Country, Occupation)

Stress Indicators (Days Indoors, Growing Stress, Mood Swings)

Mental Health History

Social and Work Interest Metrics

 How to Use
Clone the repository

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the training script:

python train_stress_model.py
Use predict_new() function to test new input samples

 Future Improvements
Add a web interface (Streamlit/Flask) for user-friendly predictions

Introduce time-series tracking for mood and stress patterns

Integrate personalized intervention suggestions (e.g., meditation, therapy, counseling)
